                      During the workshop, the barista from ChÃ¡ das Cinco will
                      show you how to prepare the perfect cup of coffee at
                      home, using some filter extraction equipment (V60,
                      Chemex, and Aeropress), as well as explain a bit of the
                      science behind coffee extraction, and how you can use
                      that knowledge to alter the taste of the drink.

                      <h3>Hugo Ferraz</h3>
                      <p>
                      I am 41 years old, and I have dedicated half my life to
                      video editing. After meeting my girlfriend Sofia in early
                      2015, we decided to create ChÃ¡ das Cinco - a pastry
                      studio, where we serve specialty coffee, fine teas, and
                      artisan pastry. A year later, I attended the beginner
                      barista course at "Academia Barista Delta", and realized
                      there is still a lot to do in this area. Between books,
                      magazines, and websites about coffee, and, in particular
                      specialty coffee, I realized I needed to learn even more.
                      And so, in early 2017 I received my SCA barista
                      certification and brewing at "Academia do CafÃ©", which
                      allowed me to consolidate some ideas and acquire
                      experience in these 2 distinct areas of the coffee world.
                      I also teach old and new baristas alike, and dedicate my
                      time understanding all the questions that come along
                      about coffee and its extraction.

                      Historically games are all about hitting silky smooth
                      frame rates, and that means at least 60 frames per
                      second. This implies that you have AT MOST 16.6
                      milliseconds to do all the awesome stuff that your game
                      does. Thatâ€™s certainly a lot of processor instructions,
                      but you can run quickly out of time depending on what you
                      are doing or if you donâ€™t think about its complexity.

                      Hopefully, in this workshop you will learn some
                      optimization techniques to help you hit that goal. We
                      will talk about our experience optimizing the game thread
                      and avoid making some common mistakes that can lead to
                      unnecessary waste of our precious resource.

                      Cristiano has been at Abyssal since he graduated from
                      MIEIC in 2016. With his constant thirst for knowledge and
                      never-ending stamina, has been gathering experience with
                      game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine 4 in the
                      past few years. He is always prepared to annoy everyone
                      around him about doing things the right way. Even though
                      he still has a long way to go when it comes about to know
                      what is the right way. Having annoyed plenty of people
                      about UE4, heâ€™s ready to pass some of that knowledge onto
                      you.

                      In this workshop the participants are confronted with the
                      proposal of a television news program, live, without
                      stops, as in television.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                      Participants begin by attending a short theoretical
                      introduction to the specific grammar of audiovisuals.
                      Topics such as plans, frames, concepts of image, rule of
                      thirds and third of image, camera movements, camera
                      angulation and height, multi-camera work, studio
                      interview and outdoor interview, etc. are discussed, an
                      approach that lasts no more than half an hour.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                      Afterwards the participants are distributed by the
                      functions they will occupy in the Newscast. (Editor,
                      anchors, journalists, meteorologist, studio and street
                      reporters, studio and overseas reporting camera
                      operators, VT operators, video and audio mixer operators,
                      graphic designers and assistants).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                      Each one is explained its function and, if appropriate,
                      explained how the equipment with which it will work,
                      works.

                      <p>
                      The necessary tests are performed (usually only 1 or 2)
                      and the recording starts. At the end you see the work
                      done.

                      film in 1995 in several high schools at national level in
                      the Paideia Program. He taught in various public and

                      <p>
                      He created the program "Let's Make Television", where
                      more than 20,000 participants have already gone through,
                      and in this program more than 200 films and more than
                      2,000 Newscasts. He has made several films among
                      documentaries, advertising spots, short films and

                      <h3>JÃºlio Santos</h3>
                      <p>
                      JÃºlio is a software engineer who started 4 companies.
                      He's one of the founders of Life on Mars, a Porto-based
                      software team with sky-high standards and aspirations.
                      He's also the CTO of Fractal, a Berlin-based blockchain
                      tech company. To this day, he has no idea what he's
                      doing, but somehow keeps merrily chugging along in
                      blissful oblivion.
