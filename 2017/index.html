                        Cleaning and caring for your computer, is it really
                        needed? What for? It is not supposed to keep working
                        for years without opening it?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Some questions that probably none of you asked since
                        you own a computer. Maintaining your machine isn't
                        hard, but it can be scary.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The truth is: no one cares about it or thinks it's
                        worth the effort. Then, you start complaining that your
                        machine "is becoming slow", "gets hot and shuts down"
                        or even that "it broke right after the warranty period,
                        the manufacturer does it on purpose so I need to buy a
                        new one."
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        After this workshop, all above questions and complaints
                        will disappear and you will have your computer as good
                        as it came out of the assembly line or, in some cases,
                        even better.

                        Currently working at Abyssal developing software for
                        deep-sea remote operated vehicles. Has 9 years of
                        experience in software engineering with experience in
                        too many programming languages. Can say with confidence
                        that hates all of them a little. It has a serious
                        problem with duplicated code and loves to do code
                        optimizations, some of them not very useful. He also
                        has a special appreciation for hardware, mainly by
                        disassembling stuff and put it back together, although
                        these sessions eventually lead to the question "Um,

                        You might've been taught how to leverage outside
                        services and frameworks as needed, to write your own
                        solutions on the technologies most appropriate to you
                        and the problem, and how deployment isn't really your
                        problem. This is not completely incorrect, but this is
                        an outdated way of looking at things, as it doesn’t
                        take into consideration things that are found valuable
                        (and for some, critical) in today’s agile world — fast
                        iteration, high reliability and continuous integration.

                        'DevOps' is a term with multiple definitions, depending
                        on who you ask. You won't come out of this workshop a
                        fully certified DevOps person, but chances are you'll
                        find some appreciation for how better everything works
                        together. We’ll bridge the divide between Dev and Ops
                        by getting your hands dirty with a couple of more
                        Ops-sided tasks.

                        We'll start from scratch and create and configure
                        something that will be of value to you in your future
                        endeavours — your own server (that you can “take home”)
                        hosting a number of valuable services: a webserver for
                        running a blog or your already existent personal
                        website with HTTPS, a torrent service that you can use
                        from anywhere, and your own (and private!) GitHub-like
                        repository to store things too precious for this world.
                        All of this while shining a light into how all these
                        things click together — and all via the command line,
                        so you can feel like The One while doing it!

                        So you're missing some gears, or maybe you lost a screw
                        or two, and so you feel the need to fire up the old 3D
                        printer and print some replacement parts.

                      <p>
                        Just as you are about to start drawing stuff, have you
                        considered parametric design? Do your parts fail to fit
                        together properly? or maybe you have a programmer's
                        streak? Perhaps you will need to print the same part
                        over and over again until it's right (trust me, you
                        will). In those cases parametric design might just be
                        useful.

                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          The essentials of 3D printing
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Parametric design, principles and resources
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Designing and printing tutorial
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>
                        Anyway, if you feel that writing code that will design
                        parts for 3D printing sounds like a good idea, this
                        might the workshop for you.

                        game using your newly learned Unity3D game development
                        skills. This game encompasses the following features:
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          2D Super Mario Bros. animated sprites

                      <p>
                        For the sake of briefness, some other game essential
                        features will not be included in this tutorial (score,
                        leaderboards, persistency of data, etc.). However, the
                        bases will be set for you to explore Unity3D and add
                        other things as you see fit, even well after the
                        workshop is finished. Maybe some powerups, enemies or
                        whatever you can think of. Let your imagination run
                        wild.
                      </p>
                      <h4>Goals</h4>
                      <p>
                        The goal of this workshop is to present the Unity3D
                        game editor, a tool that can be used for the
                        development of cross-platform games. More specifically,
                        this workshop will focus on slowly introducing
                        Unity3D’s features as a 2D game is developed in it. As
                        such, this workshop is adequate for people who have
                        some programming background (OO, such as Java or C++.
                        Ideally C#) yet new to the game development scene using
                        Unity.
                      </p>
                      <h4>Method</h4>
                      <p>
                        The workshop revolves around the development of the
                        game using already made assets (textures, sprites,
                        fonts, audio clips), focusing on the Unity editor and
                        the coding required to create such a game. The workshop
                        will be very much hands on, with every participant
                        being given access to all of the games assets, a
                        written step-by-step tutorial, a compiled version of
                        the game and the final project of the game, just in
                        case they want to repeat the whole process at their own
                        pace.
                      </p>
                      <h4>Results</h4>
                      <p>
                        By the end of the workshop you’ll have a Unity3D
                        project, made by you, of the awesome Super Angry Bowser
                        game, as well as all assets and materials from the
                        workshop. And you’ll be able to take on a new, small
                        scale 2D project using Unity.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Participants have to bring their own computer, and must
                        have knowledge of any OO programming language (ideally
                        C++, Java or C#).

                        Developments in microcontroller technology have made it
                        easier than ever to empower electronics projects with
                        internet connectivity. Armed with very basic notions of
                        electronics, programming and networking every junior
                        engineering student has, this workshop will show you
                        how to consolidate all that knowledge and put it to use
                        to build and connect real-world circuits and devices to
                        the internet.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        We will build simple circuits using Arduino-like
                        platforms and electronic components, like using
                        temperature and humidity sensors and displaying its
                        readings on a character LCD screen or using a relay
                        switch to control a light bulb. We’ll then use the
                        networking capabilities of the ESP8266 microcontroller
                        to do prototypical Internet of Things tasks, like
                        logging the sensor data with the help of a cloud
                        service, or how to control your physical circuit’s
                        on/off state from a web page.
